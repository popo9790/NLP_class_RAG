{"type": "text", "content": "Understanding the environmental impacts of different industries is an important first step towards developing effective strategies to mitigate those impacts. For newer industries such as information and communication technologies (ICT) of which Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) are considered to be a part of, more work is needed to understand the extent of their environmental impacts and the factors that influence it. Between 2017 and 2021, the electricity used by Meta, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google, the main providers of commercially-available cloud compute, more than doubled [22]. According to the most recent figures available, global data centre electricity consumption has grown by 20-40% annually in recent years, reaching 1-1.3% of global electricity demand and contributing 1% of energy-related greenhouse gas emissions in 2022 [21]. However the contribution of the AI sector specifically towards these figures is unclear. \nRecent work documenting the environmental impacts of ML has focused largely on quantifying the operational energy and carbon required to perform the training phase of the ML model life cycle [12, 30, 41, 49] due to the relative ease of measuring per-model energy use for that phase and the impressive quantity of energy required to perform a single training run [41, 49]. Yet, other phases of the ML model life cycle, such as inference, stand to impact the environment just as much, or more, than training due to the computational resources required to deploy modern models at scale. While inference on a single example requires much less computation than that required to train the same model, inference happens far more frequently than model training — as many as billions of times a day for a model powering a popular user-facing product such as Google Translate.1 Yet, in-depth work quantifying the costs of model inference and deployment is limited and their environmental impacts, in terms of energy and carbon as well as water and mining of rare earth minerals, have yet to be estimated. According to AWS, the largest global cloud provider, inference is estimated to make up 80 to 90% of total ML cloud computing demand [2, 28], whereas a 2021 publication by Meta attributed approximately one-third of their internal end-to-end ML carbon footprint to model inference, with the remainder produced by data management, storage, and training [57]; similarly, a 2022 study from Google attributed 60% of its ML energy use to inference, compared to 40% for training [40]. Given the increasing ubiquity of AI model deployment, it is crucial to go beyond these high-level statistics to get a better idea of the energy requirements and carbon emissions of model inference for different models and tasks. In particular, looking at inference rather than training leads to drastically different conclusions when considering the multi-purpose (or “general-purpose”) aspect specifically. Training a single model for multiple tasks can indeed be more energy-efficient when considering training costs only, but these gains can easily be lost and even reversed over the course of the model’s lifetime, given how much inference is carried out when these models are deployed in user-facing applications like chat and web search. \nTo help shed light on this issue, we perform an extensive study measuring the amount of energy required to deploy various ML models and architectures, including large language models (LLMs)- as such, our study is, to our knowledge, the first to focus solely on the inference phase of the ML model life cycle. We study 88 models across 10 tasks and 30 datasets, spanning applications in natural language and computer vision, analyzing the impact of end task, modality, model size, architecture, and learning paradigm (i.e. task-specific or multi-task/multi-purpose) on energy efficiency. We identify orders-of-magnitude differences in the amount of energy required per inference across models, modalities and tasks and shine light on an important trade-off between the benefit of multi-purpose systems, their energy cost, and ensuing carbon emissions.

This transition has been happening both in ML research since the advent of GPT-3 [5], which illustrated the potential for few- and zero-shot learning with language models, as well as in consumer settings, with LLMs such as GPT-4 and PaLM being deployed in user-facing products such as web search [4, 18], email, and navigation [17], where smaller, task-specific versions of models such as BERT were previously used [3, 16]. While it is hard to quantify the environmental impacts of this transition given the lack of transparency of technology companies regarding both the number of parameters, architecture and carbon emissions of their products, we can make a comparison based on the experiments carried out in the present study. For instance, the average emissions of a BERT-based model fine-tuned for extractive question answering (bert-large-uncased-whole-word-masking-finetuned-squad), a task akin to extractive web search, is 0.70g CO2eq per 1,000 queries, which is less than 3 times that of the multi-purpose models (2.36g for Flan-T5 base and 2.34g for BLOOMz-560M). The difference is much more drastic if comparing BERT-based models for tasks such as text classification with the larger multi-purpose models: for instance bert-base-multilingual-uncased-sentiment emits just 0.32g of CO2eq per 1,000 queries, compared to 2.66g for Flan-T5-XL and 4.67g for BLOOMz-7B.

{"type": "text", "content": "The Evolved Transformer neural architecture search (NAS) was used as an example of an expensive NLP model [Str19]. Although it is now surpassed by other models in terms of training cost (Table 4), we discuss it here as a concrete example of the complexity of estimating the cost of a ML method retroactively.\n\nAs Table 4 shows, the actual cost of Evolved Transformer NAS is nearly two orders of magnitude smaller than previously estimated [Str19]. Why the discrepancy? The answer is that, in addition to the efficiency of Google datacenters, there was a confusion in estimating the energy cost of NAS. In Evolved Transformer NAS, researchers used a small proxy task to search for the best models to save time and money, and then scaled up the found models to full size. Small proxies may not be obvious, which made it hard to estimate the CO2e correctly in retrospect from the NAS paper [So19]. Due to the misunderstanding of the usage of proxy tasks in NAS, it was assumed the search was done with full size tasks. Because of this assumption, despite considerable effort on their part, Strubell et al.'s energy estimate for NAS ended up 18.7X too high for the average organization (see Appendix C) and 88X off in emissions for energy-efficient organizations like Google (see Appendix D). This example led us to our first recommendation—that more researchers measure energy usage and CO2e for computationally intensive projects, and report them when practical, rather than counting on others to estimate it retrospectively.\n\nAnother confusion in the general public is the misperception that NAS (and therefore, the cost associated with NAS) is conducted once per model training. In practice, however, NAS is generally not performed once per model training, but once per problem domain+architectural search space combination. For example, the Evolved Transformer, found by NAS on translation, can be used for language modeling without a new search [So19, Adi20]. Unfortunately, results in the earlier work by [Str19] characterizing NAS were misattributed to single model training costs in the popular press.\n\nAs an analogy, NAS is like optimizing the energy efficiency and cost of an LED light bulb with extensive simulations on a supercomputer, training a model is akin to building LED light bulbs, and inference is analogous to all the customers using LEDs to light their homes. The analogous confusion would be claiming that the one-time upfront supercomputer simulation cost should be included in the CO2e cost of every light bulb manufactured. In this analogy, the onetime CO2 expenditure of the supercomputer simulations can be more than paid back with the improved energy-efficiency of the mass-produced light bulbs, as was the case for the actual NAS of [So19] (see next paragraph).\n\nIn terms of cost-benefit tradeoff, NAS can also lead to improved energy efficiency in training of downstream applications, and the benefit can dramatically outweigh the cost.

{"type": "text", "content": "[Str19] and others point out that it often takes many attempts to get everything set up correctly before the final training run, so the final training run does not reflect the total cost. Since it’s hard to improve what you can’t measure, one issue is how to account for such costs accurately. Fortunately, an internal Google product is underway that will record information about the training process, originally intended to keep track of information like data provenance. The developers now plan to add energy consumption so that Googlers can better understand the full training lifecycle. An example of an open source tool to record such information is experiment-impact-tracker [Hen20]. In addition, the developers of ML Emissions Calculator [Lac19] are currently working on CodeCarbon, whose goal is to measure/approximate carbon consumption automatically.

Since it’s hard to improve what you can’t measure, one issue is how to account for such costs accurately. Fortunately, an internal Google product is underway that will record information about the training process, originally intended to keep track of information like data provenance. The developers now plan to add energy consumption so that Googlers can better understand the full training lifecycle. An example of an open source tool to record such information is experiment-impact-tracker [Hen20].

The Study Panel reviews AI’s progress in the years following the immediately prior report, envisions the potential advances that lie ahead, and describes the technical and societal challenges and opportunities these advances raise, including in such arenas as ethics, economics, and the design of systems compatible with human cognition. The overarching purpose of the One Hundred Year Study’s periodic expert review is to provide a collected and connected set of reflections about AI and its influences as the field advances. The studies are expected to develop syntheses and assessments that provide expert-informed guidance for directions in AI research, development, and systems design, as well as programs and policies to help ensure that these systems broadly benefit individuals and society."}

{"type": "text", "content": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a science and a set of computational technologies that are inspired by—but typically operate quite differently from—the ways people use their nervous systems and bodies to sense, learn, reason, and take action. While the rate of progress in AI has been patchy and unpredictable, there have been significant advances since the field’s inception sixty years ago. Once a mostly academic area of study, twenty-first century AI enables a constellation of mainstream technologies that are having a substantial impact on everyday lives. Computer vision and AI planning, for example, drive the video games that are now a bigger entertainment industry than Hollywood. Deep learning, a form of machine learning based on layered representations of variables referred to as neural networks, has made speech-understanding practical on our phones and in our kitchens, and its algorithms can be applied widely to an array of applications that rely on pattern recognition. Natural Language Processing (NLP) and knowledge representation and reasoning have enabled a machine to beat the Jeopardy champion and are bringing new power to Web searches. While impressive, these technologies are highly tailored to particular tasks. Each application typically requires years of specialized research and careful, unique construction. In similarly targeted applications, substantial increases in the future uses of AI technologies, including more self-driving cars, healthcare diagnostics and targeted treatments, and physical assistance for elder care can be expected. AI and robotics will also be applied across the globe in industries struggling to attract younger workers, such as agriculture, food processing, fulfillment centers, and factories. They will facilitate delivery of online purchases through flying drones, self-driving trucks, or robots that can get up the stairs to the front door. This report is the first in a series to be issued at regular intervals as a part of the One Hundred Year Study on Artificial Intelligence (AI100). Starting from a charge given by the AI100 Standing Committee to consider the likely influences of AI in a typical North American city by the year 2030, the 2015 Study Panel, comprising experts in AI and other relevant areas focused their attention on eight domains they considered most salient: transportation; service robots; healthcare; education; low-resource communities; public safety and security; employment and workplace; and entertainment. In each of these domains, the report both reflects on progress in the past fifteen years and anticipates developments in the coming fifteen years. Though drawing from a common source of research, each domain reflects different AI influences and challenges, such as the difficulty of creating safe and reliable hardware (transportation and service robots), the difficulty of smoothly interacting with human experts (healthcare and education), the challenge of gaining public trust (low-resource communities and public safety and security), the challenge of overcoming fears of marginalizing humans (employment and workplace), and the social and societal risk of diminishing interpersonal interactions (entertainment). The report begins with a reflection on what constitutes Artificial Intelligence, and concludes with recommendations concerning AI-related policy. These recommendations include accruing technical expertise about AI in government and devoting more resources—and removing impediments—to research on the fairness, security, privacy, and societal impacts of AI systems. Contrary to the more fantastic predictions for AI in the popular press, the Study Panel found no cause for concern that AI is an imminent threat to humankind. No machines with self-sustaining long-term goals and intent have been developed, nor are they likely to be developed in the near future. Instead, increasingly useful applications of AI, with potentially profound positive impacts on our society and economy are likely to emerge between now and 2030, the period this report considers.

In reality, AI is already changing our daily lives, almost entirely in ways that improve human health, safety, and productivity. Unlike in the movies, there is no race of superhuman robots on the horizon or probably even possible. And while the potential to abuse AI technologies must be acknowledged and addressed, their greater potential is, among other things, to make driving safer, help children learn, and extend and enhance people’s lives. In fact, beneficial AI applications in schools, homes, and hospitals are already growing at an accelerated pace. Major research universities devote departments to AI studies, and technology companies such as Apple, Facebook, Google, IBM, and Microsoft spend heavily to explore AI applications they regard as critical to their futures. Even Hollywood uses AI technologies to bring its dystopian AI fantasies to the screen. Innovations relying on computer-based vision, speech recognition, and Natural Language Processing have driven these changes, as have concurrent scientific and technological advances in related fields. AI is also changing how people interact with technology. Many people have already grown accustomed to touching and talking to their smart phones. People’s future relationships with machines will become ever more nuanced, fluid, and personalized as AI systems learn to adapt to individual personalities and goals. These AI applications will help monitor people’s well-being, alert them to risks ahead, and deliver services when needed or wanted. For example, in a mere fifteen years in a typical North American city—the time frame and scope of this report—AI applications are likely to transform transportation toward self-driving vehicles with on-time pickup and delivery of people and packages. This alone will reconfigure the urban landscape, as traffic jams and parking challenges become obsolete. This study’s focus on a typical North American city is deliberate and meant to highlight specific changes affecting the everyday lives of the millions of people who inhabit them.

The workload evaluates a total of 3000 requests. • Offline Inference workload: To model a batch processing task, an input size of 1024 tokens and an output size of 128 tokens was used. This takes into account tasks such as document summarization and data wrangling. To simulate a batch processing task, the workload evaluates the performance of completing 1000 requests. AWS Cloud Experiment Setup: To maintain uniform experimental conditions and reduce potential disruptions caused by fluctuating cloud workloads, all experiments were carried out on AWS in the us-east-1 (Northern Virginia) region between 9:00 AM and 10:00 PM KST, spanning the period from December 2024 to March 2025. To avoid performance variations due to regional resource contention, testing was evenly distributed across availability zones us-east-1a through us-east-1f. For the GPU-VMs, we utilized g4dn.xlarge(NVIDIA T4), g5.xlarge(NVIDIA A10G), g6.xlarge(NVIDIA L4) and g6e.xlarge(NVIDIA L40s) A detailed specification of the instances are specified in Table IV."}

Furthermore, it benchmarks at most a few model architectures for each task (sometimes only one), failing to provide insights on how ML design choices impact energy consumption. The Hugging Face AI Energy Score leaderboard [27] provides measurement data for broader AI tasks. However, it fixes the inference batch size to 1 for all models, failing to reflect how services are deployed in the real world and thus their energy consumption (Section 2.2). Google disclosed the median energy consumption of their AI service [24]. It provides a comprehensive scope of measurement, even including the energy consumption of idle machines provisioned for stable service operation. However, measurements and reports are based on internal Google systems, workloads, hardware (TPUs), and model (Gemini) that are not publicly available, limiting the generalizability and reproducibility of the results (Section 2.1).

[36] investigate the usage of time-shifting technique to reduce the energy consumption of LLMs during long-running training sessions. Concretely, the authors estimates the consumption of Llama model by pausing and resuming the training when the carbon emission is below a certain threshold. The results shows that the proposed approach succeed in reducing the carbon emission even though the region may impact the obtained results. Liu and Yin [37] investigate how to reduce and measure the consumption of pre-trained models by combining fine-tuning and efficient tokenizers. In particular, BERT, DistilBERT, and T5 models are compared using SQuAD benchmark [38] in terms of accuracy and carbon emissions. The experimental results reveal that both the T5 and BERT models emitted considerably more CO2 compared to DistilBERT and the T4 GPU contributes in reducing the overall carbon emissions. Samsi et al. [13] compare the inference performance in terms of watts of different Llama models, i.e., evaluating smaller models (7B, 13B) against the largest available version (65B) at the time of writing. In addition, the authors consider different GPUs, i.e., V100 and A100. The study reveals that 8 V100 GPUs each with 32 GB of RAM or 4 A100 GPUs each with 80GB of memory are required for any meaningful inferences with the 65B LLaMA model, thus making small models a suitable choice for energy-efficient applications. Cursaro et al. [39] investigate the energy consumption of LLMs during inference and propose a method to reduce the energy consumption by using a combination of hardware and software techniques. The results show that the proposed method can reduce the energy consumption by up to 50% compared to the baseline. In addition, the authors also propose a method to estimate the energy consumption of LLMs during inference, which can be used to optimize the model selection and deployment.

{"type": "text", "content": "As the climate crisis deepens, artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a contested force: some champion its potential to advance renewable energy, materials discovery, and large-scale emissions monitoring, while others underscore its growing carbon footprint, water consumption, and material resource demands. Much of this debate has concentrated on direct impacts—energy and water usage in data centers, e-waste from frequent hardware upgrades—without addressing the significant indirect effects. This paper examines how the problem of Jevons’ Paradox applies to AI, whereby efficiency gains may paradoxically spur increased consumption.

{"type": "text", "content": "In economics and lifecycle assessment, direct impacts, such as those described in the previous section, are those engendered by the product during its lifecycle, whereas indirect (or second order) impacts refer to systemic responses to the development of the product in terms of behavioral or structural changes which affect on other processes, structures and lifestyles [22, 97, 136]. Indirect impacts also include rebound effects, which occur when the improvement of one aspect of a product results in unintended negative consequences due to increased adoption, usage, and workloads [13]. These impacts inevitably come with consequences to the environment due to the increased usage, or a redistribution in the usage, of natural resources.

This requires including AI’s direct impacts—mineral supply chain studies, carbon emissions of training large-scale models, energy and water consumption, and e-waste from hardware—as well as mapping the ways AI innovations reshape economic structures and societal practices that, in turn, drive increased resource usage. Such a comprehensive perspective will empower researchers, policymakers, and industry stakeholders to devise strategies that prevent “tech-solutionism” from overshadowing the urgent need for systemic change. Greater transparency in reporting energy usage, more robust lifecycle assessment tools, and meaningful industry-wide enforceable standards are examples that would foster much-needed progress.

{"type": "text", "content": "While the total carbon footprint of the field of ML is unclear due its distributed nature and the lack of systematic reporting of emissions in different settings, in the face of the climate crisis, it is important for the ML community to acquire a better understanding of its environmental footprint and how to reduce it [28, 38]. Our study is the first analysis of the carbon emissions of a multitude of ML models from different perspectives ranging from energy source to performance. While our sample is only a small portion of the entire Machine Learning field, the carbon emissions associated to the models in our data set is significant: the total carbon emissions of the models analyzed in our study is about 253 tons of CO2eq, which is equivalent to about 100 flights from London to San Francisco or from Nairobi to Beijing. While this may not seem like a large amount, the increase in emissions in recent years – from an average of 487 tons of CO2eq for models from 2015-2016 to an average of 2020 tons for models trained in 2020-2022 – as well as other trends that we observed in Section 4.3, indicate that the overall emissions due to ML model are rising. \n\nIn Section 4, we have discussed that the main sources of variance in the amount of emissions associated to training machine learning models is due to the carbon intensity of the primary energy source and the training time, with the power consumption of the hardware having a smaller influence. In terms of training time, the models in our sample range from just about 15 minutes (total GPU/TPU time) up to more than 400,000 hours, with a median of 72 hours, pointing again to large variance in our sample. While the maximum of of 400,000 GPU hours (equivalent to about 170 days with 100 GPUs) in our sample seems very large, note that the total training time of GPT-3 was estimated to be over 3.5 million hours (14.8 days with 10,000 GPUs) [38]. Obviously, such long training times result in large amounts of carbon emissions, even with lower carbon intensity energy sources. By way of illustration, the model with the longest training time in our sample would have reduced by about 30 times the carbon emissions had it used the grid with the lowest carbon intensity in our sample, but it would have still resulted in over 1 ton of CO2eq. Also, generally speaking, we can see that the models at the higher end of the emissions spectrum tend to be Transformer-based model with more layers (as well as using techniques such as Neural Architecture Search to find optimal combinations of parameters), whereas simpler and shallower models such as convolutional neural networks tend to be on the lower end of the emissions spectrum. Given that Transformer architectures are increasing in popularity – especially in NLP but also for several Computer Vision tasks – having a better idea of their energy consumption, carbon emissions, and the factors that influence them is also crucial part of analyzing the current and future state of our field. \n\nAn important observation from our analysis is that better performance is not generally achieved by using more energy. In other words, good performance can be achieved with limited carbon emissions because the progress in recent years has brought the possibility to train machine learning models efficiently. Image Classification is the task in our sample in which we observed the strongest correlation between performance and emissions.

Our goal to match 100% of the electricity consumed by our global operations with renewable energy by 2025 is a milestone that is now part of our broader carbon-free energy strategy."}

In 2024 and beyond, we will continue to add more carbon-free energy generation and storage capacity to our portfolio as we scale up new technologies such as AI and work toward our goal to achieve net-zero carbon by 2040. This will include investing in more solar and wind energy projects, such as our Moray West offshore wind farm in Scotland, and nuclear projects.

Meta’s self-reported scope-2 water consumption for its global data center fleet was 3.7 L/kWh (i.e., 55,475 megaliters divided by 14,975,435 MWh) in 2023 [18]."}

Consequently, the vast majority of data centers, even including those newly built by major technology companies, depend on onsite diesel generators for backup power [6,60]. For example, in Northern Virginia (mostly in Loudoun, Prince William, and Fairfax), the number of permits for data center diesel generators has increased by more than 70% since 2023 compared to the total number of permits issued between 2000 and 2022 [60]. Importantly, nearly all the diesel generators are Tier 2, which have significantly higher emission rates than Tier 4 units [60,61]. The total permitted annual emission limits for these diesel generators are approximately 13,000 tons of NOx, 1,400 tons of VOCs, 50 tons of SO2, and 600 tons of PM2.5, all in U.S. short tons. While diesel generators need to comply with air quality regulations and typically do not operate over extended periods of time, regular maintenance and testing are essential to ensure their operational reliability. A recent report by the state of Virginia [42] found that the actual air pollutant emissions from backup generators at Virginia’s data centers reached approximately 7% of the total permitted amounts in 2023, primarily for maintenance. Likewise, the actual emissions took up 3% to 12% of the permitted levels for some data centers in Quincy, Washington [43]. Moreover, the U.S. EPA recently issued a clarification that would allow data centers to run backup generators for up to 50 hours a year (or roughly 10% of the permits that typically allow 500 hours per year) to participate in demand response—a program designed to reduce grid demand during peak hours, which is increasingly activated as surging data center demand strains grid capacity [44]. This trend may necessitate extended reliance on backup generators [6]. What further adds to the public health impact is that many data center generators in a region may operate simultaneously for demand response during grid capacity shortages, potentially resulting in a short-term spike in PM2.5 and NOx emissions that can be particularly harmful [6,23,48].

{"type": "text", "content": "In this paper, we quantify and address the overlooked public health impact of data centers. We introduce a principled methodology to model these lifecycle pollutant emissions and quantify their associated public health impacts. Our findings suggest that the total annual public health burden of U.S. data centers could exceed $20 billion by 2028, approaching or even surpassing the impacts of on-road vehicle emissions in California. Importantly, these health costs are not evenly distributed: disadvantaged communities bear a disproportionate share, with per-household impacts potentially up to 200 times higher than in less-affected areas. This highlights the need for targeted mitigation strategies. To this end, we propose health-informed computing, a framework that explicitly incorporates public health risk as a key metric when scheduling data center workloads, enabling more informed and equitable operational decisions.\n\nMore broadly, we recommend the adoption of standardized reporting protocols for the public health costs of data centers, alongside policies that ensure attention to all impacted communities, thereby supporting responsible, sustainable, and inclusive deployment of AI infrastructure.", "id": 74, "doc_id": "han2024", "page": 19, "embedded_text": "In this paper, we quantify and address the overlooked public health impact of data centers.

{"type": "text", "content": "Climate change is an increasing threat to life on our planet, which disproportionately impacts the most disadvantaged communities and fragile ecosystems [28]. One of the main drivers of climate change is carbon dioxide, or CO2, which contributes to the greenhouse effect by trapping the heat from the sun within the atmosphere without letting it dissipate. CO2 (and other types of greenhouse gases, such as methane and ozone) are emitted by many sources, some natural but most man-made, such as the burning of oil and gas for transportation and heating or for industrial processes such as smelting. In 2018, it was estimated that global data center energy use represented close to 1% of global energy usage [27]. While it is not yet known what proportion of data center use is for training artificial intelligence (AI) models, it is undeniable that AI and its sub-fields have grown dramatically in recent years, with no sign of slowing down [39, 43]. While a number of papers have addressed the CO2 emissions produced by AI (e.g., [23, 26, 33, 34]), the extent and provenance of CO2 emissions in the field is still under-explored. Nonetheless, a common theme of previous work is that it aims to estimate the emissions produced by training AI models, or carrying out the accompanying neural architecture search (NAS) process, based on coarse measures such as CO2 emissions of electricity used in the region where the computations were carried out (e.g., [42]), or post-hoc analyses using information that is not publicly available (e.g., [34]).\n\nWith an increasing amount of AI model training being done on cloud compute instances, reducing the emissions generated by these workloads will be key to reducing our carbon footprint as a field. However, to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from cloud computing, we need consider the role of two types of actors: the cloud provider (such as Microsoft Azure, Google’s GCP, or Amazon’s AWS) and the user who reserves and uses cloud resources (e.g., an AI researcher training a model on a cloud instance, or a company hosting a website). Typically, the provider’s motivation is to build a system where users can access the computing power and storage that best meets their needs. The user, on the other hand, is motivated by some end task which requires computing power, such as running a set of experiments or putting a model into production. Often the user will first consider the minimal computational requirements to achieve their goals, then later ease-of-use features relating to transfer speed or extra storage depending on available budget. Driven by these motivations, providers and users can each take actions to meet their goals: providers can build data centers and set up APIs to enable users’ access and accounting, while users can choose their cloud provider, which region to use, and the number and type of cloud instances required for their end task at a given point in time. Based on these stakeholders and motivations, in this work we address the following research questions: 1) how should we measure and report operational carbon costs of AI workloads? And 2) can we shift computation spatially and temporally to mitigate emissions?\n\nIn this article, we introduce the first tool to estimate the real-time CO2 emissions impact of instances on a cloud computing platform. The tool calculates operational carbon emissions by using location-based and time-specific marginal emissions data per energy unit. Using the tool, we explore several case studies on the Microsoft Azure cloud compute platform spanning the areas of natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision, estimating the carbon intensity of training a variety of commonly used machine learning models. We also explore two avenues for users of cloud instances to reduce their CO2 using this tool by: (1) Changing the region of compute and (2) changing the time of day during which the model is run. While the former has been recognized by prior work [13, 23], we are the first to address the latter to the best of our knowledge. Further, our tool makes it possible to automatically schedule jobs in order to reduce their carbon footprint by leveraging these differences in carbon intensity due to time and geographic location.

{"type": "text", "content": "Large language models (LLMs) (Radford et al. 2018; Touvron et al. 2023a; Devlin et al. 2019; Raffel et al. 2020) have consistently demonstrated their efficacy across a spectrum of applications, especially in language processing (Wang et al. 2022b,a; Fan et al. 2022; Liu et al. 2022) and multimodal tasks (Zhao et al. 2023; Meng et al. 2023). Despite variations in architectural designs, a universal challenge confronting all LLMs is the escalating cost associated with their training. Recent trends indicate a shift towards utilizing larger amounts of data (e.g., 1.4T tokens for Llama-1 (Touvron et al. 2023a), 2T tokens for Llama-2 (Touvron et al. 2023b), and 15T tokens for Llama-3 (Meta 2024)). Meanwhile, the sizes of open-sourced models continue to increase (Penedo et al. 2023; Bi et al. 2024; Mistral 2024). Consequently, a major focus within LLM research is the development of innovative methodologies that effectively mitigate training expenses, aligning with the broader objectives of Green AI (Schwartz et al. 2020).\nIn this paper, we present our exploration to train an LLM at the 100B-parameter scale using a growth strategy inspired by previous research on progressive learning (Gong et al. 2019; Gu et al. 2021; Yao et al. 2024) and neurogenesis (Eriksson et al. 1998). “Growth” means dynamic expansion of the parameter number count, from small to large, through the training progresses. Figure 1 illustrates three typical growth strategies: linear, sublinear, and superlinear. As the FLOPs of LLMs are approximately proportional to their number of parameters (Hoffmann et al. 2022), the area under the parameter curve represents the computational cost of training.\nWhile existing studies on scaling laws (Hoffmann et al. 2022) suggest that training a smaller model with more data may potentially result in higher scores on some tasks under a fixed FLOPs budget, they mainly consider the scenarios where model sizes are fixed through training. We believe that verifying the feasibility of a growth strategy (Gu et al. 2021; Shen et al. 2022; Chen et al. 2022; Yao et al. 2024) for extremely large models would be an important completion to scaling laws.

Research done in the following years extended this analysis, for instance by calculating the energy use and GHG footprint for several notable AI models including GPT-3, T5, Meena, and Switch Transformer, providing new estimates16 and expanding the scope of analysis beyond model training to account for operational and embodied emissions17, improving methodology for software energy measurement18, and a lifecycle approach to assessing emissions from model training and deployment11. Wu et al. further advanced this analysis by explicitly mapping the environmental impacts across the entire AI development pipeline,19. Most recently, Luccioni, Jernite, and Strubell 20 pioneered the AI inference impact methodology, revealing generative architectures as particularly energy-intensive compared to task-specific models and underscoring the critical importance of addressing inference impacts. These methodologies were then adapted into the AI Energy Score 21, a project aiming to establish a unified approach for comparing the inference efficiency of AI models22. Above and beyond energy considerations, Li et al.23 expanded the scope of AI environmental impact measurement by estimating the water footprint of GPT-3 based on publicly available information, whereas Han et al.24 assessed the public health toll of AI training’s air pollution, finding that training an AI model of the LLaMa 3.1 scale can produce air pollutants equivalent to more than 10,000 round trips by car between Los Angeles and New York City.

{"type": "text", "content": "Among the first efforts to quantify the environmental impacts of AI was the 2019 study by Strubell et al.,¹² which estimated the monetary costs, energy use, and GHG emissions required to train a variety of typical natural language processing (NLP) models of that era, including the first generation of large language models. This analysis included both the costs to train several individual models, including the two original “base” (65M) and “big” (213M parameter) variants of the Transformer neural network architecture³⁰ that forms the basis of LLMs to this day, as well as the cost to perform model development, i.e. identifying the best model architecture with respect to some optimization objective. The authors quantified the costs of model development through both a case study of the energy required for them to develop a model published in the previous year, and by estimating the energy required to automate that process using an approach called neural architecture search (NAS) based on figures reported in a recent Google study using NAS to identify an optimized variant of the Transformer architecture.³¹ In the case of the latter, they estimated that the NAS approach, assuming United States average electricity GHG emissions intensity and typical AI hardware running in an average-efficiency datacenter, could yield 626,155 pounds (284 metric tons) CO₂-equivalent GHG emissions (CO₂e), or about five times the emissions of a car during its lifetime, including fuel. The research article was written for a specialized audience of AI and NLP researchers, who would have the background knowledge to understand the appropriate scoping for the estimate. However, an author’s tweet publicizing the paper and featuring a table containing the “five cars” estimate was widely shared on social media, leading to the publication being picked up by numerous media outlets (including MIT Technology Review³² and Forbes³³). The “five cars” number has since been misinterpreted as a proxy for the carbon footprint of training AI models at large, which is misleading given the diversity of architectures, training approaches and electricity sources used for powering AI model training; the original article reports AI training workloads emitting as little as 26 pounds (11.8 kg) CO₂e (assuming U.S. average energy carbon emissions intensity), and AI model training more broadly often requires even less energy and corresponding emissions. Further, the NAS training workload represents a large-scale procedure that is meant to be and is in practice performed much less frequently than the average AI model training workload. This is both because the result is intended to be re-used as a basis to reduce the emissions of subsequent training workloads, and because the scale of resources (financial and/or computational) significantly limits who can perform such large-scale training runs. In this way, the NAS training workload is similar to today’s generative AI pretraining workloads, which are similarly performed less frequently than the average AI training. However, while the “five cars” estimate from Strubell et al. is not an accurate representation of the emissions arising from every AI training workload, recent first-hand reports of the estimated GHG emissions arising from language model pretraining typically exceed the “five cars” estimate: Google reports that training their open source Gemma family of language models emitted 1247.61 tons CO₂e,³⁴ over 4x the estimate that forms the basis for the “five cars” number, and Meta reports that their Llama 3 family of models emitted 11,390 tons CO₂e³⁵ or over 40x the “five cars” estimate.", "id": 11, "doc_id": "luccioni2025c", "page": 4, "embedded_text": "Among the first efforts to quantify the environmental impacts of AI was the 2019 study by Strubell et al.,¹² which estimated the monetary costs, energy use, and GHG emissions required to train a variety of typical natural language processing (NLP) models of that era, including the first generation of large language models.

However, policymakers should incorporate additional reporting requirements specifically addressing AI system utilization under standards such as European Sustainability Reporting Standards E1 (Climate Change) which mandates the disclosure of Scope 1, 2, and 3 GHG emissions, energy usage, and a transition plan aligned with the Paris Agreement –, particularly as this aligns with existing provisions in the EU AI Act. Non-governmental sustainability rating agencies such as CDP and EcoVadis should similarly expand their assessment criteria to incorporate AI-specific environmental impact metrics, creating market incentives for improved disclosure practices. For organizations directly participating in the AI value chain (service providers, data center operators, developers, IT integrators, semiconductor and GPU manufacturers) policymakers should implement more stringent transparency requirements. These could include mandatory detailed environmental reporting disaggregated by model, usage patterns, and physical infrastructure. Enforcement mechanisms might include annual comprehensive environmental reports or conditioning access to public markets and funding on compliance with disclosure standards."}

{"type": "text", "content": "The current trend toward reduced transparency around AI’s environmental impact contributes to misinformation and hinders informed decision-making across all levels, from individual researchers and developers to organizations and policymakers. This declining transparency is particularly troubling given AI’s escalating environmental impacts amid global climate concerns and looming planetary boundaries. While competition is frequently cited to justify opacity, other competitive industries, such as food (with ingredient labeling) and healthcare (with side-effect and pricing transparency), demonstrate that a balance between transparency and competition is achievable. Reversing the trend toward opacity in AI environmental reporting is essential for informed decision-making, accountability, and sustainable technology advancement, particularly as new model paradigms emerge that may alter these impacts. As members of the AI community committed to addressing the climate crisis, we aim to ensure the sustainability of our field as it continues to expand – recognizing that increased transparency is fundamental to this goal.", "id": 32, "doc_id": "luccioni2025c", "page": 7, "embedded_text": "The current trend toward reduced transparency around AI’s environmental impact contributes to misinformation and hinders informed decision-making across all levels, from individual researchers and developers to organizations and policymakers.

{"type": "text", "content": "AI companies and cloud providers typically rely on dynamic batching to optimize GPU utilization while maintaining low latency [52]. Although actual batch sizes fluctuate depending on incoming demand, they are generally constrained to a narrow range below 16 to preserve responsiveness. Benchmarks [51] show that even for large prompts, most models maintain a first-token latency below one second. Moreover, prior studies [53, 54] show that these latency values are consistent with batch sizes in the range of 4 to 16. This suggests that real-world deployments prioritize small, latency-sensitive batches over maximal throughput. Accordingly, we adopt a batch size of 8 for all primary calculations, as it represents a practical midpoint between common deployment scenarios. A detailed sensitivity analysis exploring the impact of alternative batch sizes is provided in Appendix A.

Although actual batch sizes fluctuate depending on incoming demand, they are generally constrained to a narrow range below 16 to preserve responsiveness. Benchmarks [51] show that even for large prompts, most models maintain a first-token latency below one second. Moreover, prior studies [53, 54] show that these latency values are consistent with batch sizes in the range of 4 to 16. This suggests that real-world deployments prioritize small, latency-sensitive batches over maximal throughput.

While model design enhances theoretical efficiency, real-world outcomes can substantially diverge based on deployment conditions and factors such as renewable energy usage and hardware efficiency. For instance, GPT-4o mini, despite its smaller architecture, consumes approximately 20% more energy than GPT-4o on long queries due to reliance on older A100 GPU nodes. Similarly, DeepSeek models highlight the profound impact of infrastructure: DeepSeek-R1 and DeepSeek-V3 deployed on DeepSeek’s own servers exhibit water consumption and carbon emissions nearly six times higher than their Azure-hosted counterparts. The Azure deployments benefit from better hardware, more efficient cooling systems, lower carbon intensity, and tighter PUE control, demonstrating that sustainability gains can stem as much from datacenter design as from model optimization.

Although recent work shows the carbon footprint of training one large ML model, such as Meena [21], is equivalent to 242,231 miles driven by an average passenger vehicle [22], this is only one aspect; to fully understand the real environmental impact we must consider the AI ecosystem holistically going forward — beyond looking at model training alone and by accounting for both operational and embodied carbon footprint of AI.

The exact system deployment choice can be multifaceted — the cadence of ML algorithm and model architecture evolution, the diversity of ML use cases and the respective system resource requirements, and the maturity of the software stack. While ML accelerator deployment brings a step-function improvement in operational energy efficiency, it may not necessarily reduce the carbon footprint of AI computing overall.

Figure 11 shows that the federated learning and optimization process emits non-negligible carbon at the edge due to both computation and wireless communication during the process. To estimate the carbon emission, we used a similar methodology to [114]. We collected the 90-day log data for federated learning production use cases at Facebook, which recorded the time spent on computation, data downloading, and data uploading per client device. We multiplied the computation time with the estimated device power and upload/download time with the estimated router power, and omitted other energy. We assumed a device power of 3W and a router power of 7.5W [115], [114]. Model training on client edge devices is inherently less energy-efficient because of the high wireless communication overheads, sub-optimal training data distribution in individual client devices, and highly-fragmented edge device architectures that make system-level optimization significantly more challenging [116].

To estimate the carbon emission, we used a similar methodology to [114]. We collected the 90-day log data for federated learning production use cases at Facebook, which recorded the time spent on computation, data downloading, and data uploading per client device. We multiplied the computation time with the estimated device power and upload/download time with the estimated router power, and omitted other energy. We assumed a device power of 3W and a router power of 7.5W [115], [114]. Model training on client edge devices is inherently less energy-efficient because of the high wireless communication overheads, sub-optimal training data distribution in individual client devices, and highly-fragmented edge device architectures that make system-level optimization significantly more challenging [116]. Note, the wireless communication energy cost takes up a significant portion of the overall energy footprint of federated learning, making energy footprint optimization on communication important."}

{"type": "text", "content": "Hivemind [39] is a PyTorch-based [32] framework developed initially to enable collaborative DL training where participants could donate their heterogeneous hardware to train a single model together in a data-parallel fashion. Its main difference to other state-of-the-art distributed training frameworks, such as PyTorch DDP [26] and DeepSpeed [35], is that it runs in a decentralized fashion and can handle peers that drop out at any stage of the training. It does so with two features: a distributed hash table [31] (DHT) which spans over all participating peers for metadata storage, such as training progress and peer health, and a gradient averaging algorithm that is designed to reduce the impact of lost gradients. A key difference to other distributed training frameworks is the definition of a hivemind epoch, which is the number of samples that must be aggregated before an averaging step is performed. This sample count is called the target batch size (TBS), which corresponds to the minibatch size in standard DL training. The DHT is used for coordination, and shortly before the TBS is predicted to be reached, the peers start to form the initial groups for averaging. The time allocated for group forming is called matchmaking time and typically runs asynchronously to the training (cf. Section 3). The individual peer gradients are accumulated locally and sent to the other peers via an adaptive all-reduce algorithm (MoshpitSGD [38]). The next hivemind epoch starts after each peer applies the accumulated gradients to the local model. The advantage of Hivemind for geo-distributed training comes from cumulating different techniques, such as Delayed Parameter Updates [36], big-batch training [44] and aggressive communication quantization [16].

Since our bandwidth measurements were 210 and 130 Mb/s from the US to the EU and ASIA, respectively (Table 3), this suggests that the averaging was done over the US node and not an N-to-N all-reduce (a detailed analysis of how averaging affects bandwidths is discussed in Section 6).

{"type": "text", "content": "each peer sends its gradients to every other peer. This means that 1/3 of the egress was internal to the partner VM in the same cloud, and the remaining 2/3 went to the remaining two peers in the other cloud. First, loading data from Backblaze costs $0.01/GB from anywhere in the world, which gives us a rate of $0.144/h for the CV and $0.083/h for the NLP experiments. Even when CV throughput is less than half of the NLP model (Figure 10a), images are much larger than text, resulting in a higher data rate. While this is close to the spot instance costs of GC ($0.18/h) and Azure ($0.134/h), these are one-time costs until the entire dataset is downloaded and retrieved from the disk cache, assuming large enough local storage. A more detailed comparison of cloud provider storage offerings is beyond our scope, but current prices range from $0.02/GB to $0.14/GB in various GC regions, making our setting (B2) competitive. Second, the external egress costs for the NLP experiments are very high compared to the other costs. They are 2.2x higher than the spot instance for GC and 5.7x higher for Azure, as the traffic costs in the US zone are $0.01/GB and $0.02/GB, respectively. The Azure cost is even higher ($0.763/h) than the on-demand instance price of $0.489/h. The CV experiments are much less affected due to the smaller model size, but Azure still manages to almost match its spot instance price of $0.134/h with the external egress cost of $0.115/h. Finally, the total compute cost, including egress and data loading in this multi-cloud constellation, is the sum of all the cloud providers' prices times the number of VMs used. For the CV experiments, GC, AWS, and Azure cost $0.762/h, $1.192/h, and $0.363/h, respectively, making the combination of GC with Azure 42% cheaper than GC with AWS. For the NLP experiments, GC, AWS, and Azure cost $0.835/h, $1.05/h, and $0.973/h, respectively, and GC combined with Azure is better than GC with AWS by a smaller margin of 3.9%. However, the intercontinental network egress prices for both GC and Azure are up to 15 times higher than the inter-zone prices, so what about the cost-effectiveness compared to geo-distributed experiments? (3) Geo-distributed egress can incur most of the cost. To illustrate the cost of intercontinental training, we use our C-8 experiment with two VMs in four continents from Section 4 to plug the cost for each cloud provider. The egress costs are calculated slightly differently than in the D-2 and D-3 experiments because four groups of two VMs average locally and then distribute the gradients across the other groups. This results in 8/20 internal egress calls (two calls between each group), 6/20 intercontinental egress calls (two calls between three regions), and 6/20 AUS egress calls (three regions share their gradients with AUS and vice versa). Figure 11b shows the resulting egress traffic cost per VM. The high cost between continents scales to a multiple of the remaining cost for CV and NLP with GC and Azure. For NLP, the external egress cost for GC is $4.329/h, more than 90% of the total cost per VM ($4.804/h). Even with Azure having a more moderate rate of $0.02/GB for intercontinental communication and only $0.08/GB for OCE traffic, it still results in $1.882/h external egress cost ($2.101/h total). This is in contrast to AWS, which has a cap of $0.02/GB to any location, resulting in the best total cost of $1.376/h per VM. The relatively high AWS instance cost compares favorably to the other cloud providers regarding geo-distributed training. Keeping egress traffic in mind when deciding to scale to other continents is essential, as it can be the most significant part of the total cost. This raises another question: If egress traffic matters so much, how does model size affect it? (4) Small models have lower egress rates than larger models. Model size affects two parts of the distributed training time. First, larger models tend to have slower averaging rates, but more data movement costs due to their size. However, larger models are also averaged less frequently because they take longer to perform a step. To analyze this, we review the experiments in Section 3, where we evaluate different model sizes and GPUs counts. Figure 12 shows the average egress rate over each experiment's runtime for both CV and NLP from two to eight A10 GPUs. The trend is clear: the smaller the model, the lower the egress rate for all GPUs (e.g., RN18 vs. RN50). This is surprising, as the \"square-cube\" law [37] states that with a decrease in parameters, the calculation time will decrease quadratically while the communication time decreases linearly. This means that with a sufficiently small model, most of the training will consist of communication time, and the egress rate would increase, as it is defined through parameter count calculation time. However, we find that even with our smallest model, RN18, with 11.7M parameters and eight A10 GPUs, we are still not at the point where the communication time takes up most of the time. In summary, multi-cloud training is generally possible and can be cost-effective when keeping the egress costs and granularity in mind. Regardless of the cloud provider, staying in the same region is preferred, with the US having the most favorable egress price offers. A significant portion of the cost may be hidden in egress costs, accounting for more than 90% of the total cost in our NLP experiments in GC and Azure. Based on the additional egress costs alone, renting on-demand hardware may be more advantageous than using spot instances between different regions. CV training is generally more calculation- than communication-heavy, resulting in slightly higher data-loading but fewer egress costs. However, from our experiments, this is a favorable trade-off because data-loading is much cheaper than egress costs.", "id": 40, "doc_id": "erben2023", "page": 8, "embedded_text": "each peer sends its gradients to every other peer. This means that 1/3 of the egress was internal to the partner VM in the same cloud, and the remaining 2/3 went to the remaining two peers in the other cloud. First, loading data from Backblaze costs $0.01/GB from anywhere in the world, which gives us a rate of $0.144/h for the CV and $0.083/h for the NLP experiments. Even when CV throughput is less than half of the NLP model (Figure 10a), images are much larger than text, resulting in a higher data rate. While this is close to the spot instance costs of GC ($0.18/h) and Azure ($0.134/h), these are one-time costs until the entire dataset is downloaded and retrieved from the disk cache, assuming large enough local storage. A more detailed comparison of cloud provider storage offerings is beyond our scope, but current prices range from $0.02/GB to $0.14/GB in various GC regions, making our setting (B2) competitive. Second, the external egress costs for the NLP experiments are very high compared to the other costs. They are 2.2x higher than the spot instance for GC and 5.7x higher for Azure, as the traffic costs in the US zone are $0.01/GB and $0.02/GB, respectively. The Azure cost is even higher ($0.763/h) than the on-demand instance price of $0.489/h. The CV experiments are much less affected due to the smaller model size, but Azure still manages to almost match its spot instance price of $0.134/h with the external egress cost of $0.115/h. Finally, the total compute cost, including egress and data loading in this multi-cloud constellation, is the sum of all the cloud providers' prices times the number of VMs used. For the CV experiments, GC, AWS, and Azure cost $0.762/h, $1.192/h, and $0.363/h, respectively, making the combination of GC with Azure 42% cheaper than GC with AWS. For the NLP experiments, GC, AWS, and Azure cost $0.835/h, $1.05/h, and $0.973/h, respectively, and GC combined with Azure is better than GC with AWS by a smaller margin of 3.9%. However, the intercontinental network egress prices for both GC and Azure are up to 15 times higher than the inter-zone prices, so what about the cost-effectiveness compared to geo-distributed experiments? (3) Geo-distributed egress can incur most of the cost. To illustrate the cost of intercontinental training, we use our C-8 experiment with two VMs in four continents from Section 4 to plug the cost for each cloud provider. The egress costs are calculated slightly differently than in the D-2 and D-3 experiments because four groups of two VMs average locally and then distribute the gradients across the other groups. This results in 8/20 internal egress calls (two calls between each group), 6/20 intercontinental egress calls (two calls between three regions), and 6/20 AUS egress calls (three regions share their gradients with AUS and vice versa). Figure 11b shows the resulting egress traffic cost per VM. The high cost between continents scales to a multiple of the remaining cost for CV and NLP with GC and Azure. For NLP, the external egress cost for GC is $4.329/h, more than 90% of the total cost per VM ($4.804/h). Even with Azure having a more moderate rate of $0.02/GB for intercontinental communication and only $0.08/GB for OCE traffic, it still results in $1.882/h external egress cost ($2.101/h total). This is in contrast to AWS, which has a cap of $0.02/GB to any location, resulting in the best total cost of $1.376/h per VM. The relatively high AWS instance cost compares favorably to the other cloud providers regarding geo-distributed training. Keeping egress traffic in mind when deciding to scale to other continents is essential, as it can be the most significant part of the total cost.

However, how does it compare in throughput per $ to all of our distributed cloud experiments? The Figure 1 (CV) and Figure 15 (NLP) show the complete cost analysis of the DGX-2, the 8xT4 experiments, and the 8xA10 experiments for spot and on-demand pricing. We use the internal egress costs from Figure 11a as a reference for the 8xT4 setup. For simplicity, we compare the spot pricing without interruptions, as we assume that a new VM can be spun up fast enough not to affect the training throughput in the long run. We mark the centralized baseline (DGX-2) cost per 1M samples and the throughput in samples per second with a horizontal and vertical line. This means that we are cheaper to the left to the vertical line, and above the horizontal line, we are faster (and vice versa). We circle the new value propositions that we enable in both figures. Our hardware setups have additional key characteristics: They are resilient by default to interruptions due to running in a decentralized fashion and they enable the combination of more GPUs than cloud providers offer in a single node. Currently, common hardware configurations (DGX) allow up to eight GPUs connected via NVLink, and with older hardware, only up to 4xT4s connected via PCIe at 10 GB/s between GPUs (with GC). We were able to combine eight single GPU nodes from GC and LambdaLabs to create competing performance and price setups without dedicated GPU interconnects. A spot DGX-2 costs at the time of writing $6.30/h ($14.60/h on-demand) in GC US, which makes it the best value proposition for the low granularity NLP task. It is followed by the 8xA10, which are 41% slower and 30% more expensive than the DGX-2 (Figure 15). The 8xT4 experiments are even more expensive, as the internal egress costs take up more than half of the costs, making them the worst value proposition. However, for CV, we manage to provide two new offerings: First, the 8xA10, which is both 50% faster and 49% cheaper than the DGX-2, and 8xT4, which is 58% cheaper than DGX-2, while being 37% slower (Figure 1). The CV model can be scaled more easily due to its initially high granularity, which makes the very competitive offering of $0.6/h per A10 from LambdaLabs an excellent value proposition. However, while we only evaluated eight T4 GPUs for our GC-based experiments, with a granularity of 5.19 (CV A-8 in Figure 7b), there is ample space to scale even further. It is important to note that LambdaLabs does not charge for any data egress, but GC does with $0.01/GB, and the 8xT4 experiment is still cheaper. While LambdaLabs is often at capacity, Google Cloud positions itself as a hyperscaler with the advantage of rarely being at max occupancy. We also evaluated the performance of the 4xT4 PyTorch DDP [26] for CV with the best available multi-T4 node on GC (4xT4). The NLP experiments ran OOM. Since the DDP 4xT4 runs on a single node, it causes no interconnect costs and is priced at $0.96 per 1M samples at spot pricing, while our 8xT4 setup costs $1.77 per 1M samples (84% more expensive).

{"type": "text", "content": "This paper analyzes multi- and hybrid-cloud training in a decentralized fashion on spot instances. We define the lower bounds of model sizes that can be scaled cost-efficiently using the granularity metric to estimate their suitability for distributed training in low-bandwidth, high-latency situations. We show that training on multiple cloud providers and four continents still scales with additional compute resources. Alternatively to the current use of spot instances in DL, we show the potential of using spot instances in a distributed, decentralized way by being more cost-efficient with eight T4 instances over a DGX-2 from the same cloud provider while paying additional egress costs. Finally, we provide an intuition about where costs in such a training scenario come from and how different model sizes from CV and NLP affect throughput and costs. Our work empowers practitioners to utilize spot-priced instances for distributed deep learning with relatively small models. Our insights show some potential that can further improve distributed training performance, such as optimizers with higher minibatch sizes and improvements regarding the communication time with, e.g., better compression.", "id": 60, "doc_id": "erben2023", "page": 12, "embedded_text": "This paper analyzes multi- and hybrid-cloud training in a decentralized fashion on spot instances.

{"type": "text", "content": "We perform a case study on Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) to showcase spot training on weaker GPUs. Whisper [34] is a state-of-the-art ASR model trained on 680,000 hours of labeled data to transcribe audio. It features different sizes, from 37.8M to 1.5B parameters, and was trained with a minibatch size of 256. We use the Commonvoice [11] dataset, preprocessed to Log-Mel spectrograms. In our distributed experiments, we start with a TBS of 256 and increase to 512 and 1024 to combat potential granularity issues. Due to memory constraints, only three model sizes (Tiny, Base, Small) were trainable on the T4 GPU. Unfortunately, the original TBS of 256 was not large enough to train the relatively small models due to their small granularity (0.04, 0.14 and 0.57 at 8xT4, respectively) with no performance benefits. The only model showing scaling potential is WhisperSmall, with a granularity of 1.8 with 2xT4. However, when scaling the target batch size to 512 and 1024, we see some benefit over the single GPU runs for the WhisperSmall model (Figure 16). By effectively increasing the amount of computation by the factors of 2 and 4, we can generate a speedup of 1.27× and 2.2× with 8xT4’s for the TBS 512 and 1024, respectively. When compared to other hardware setups, our A100 80GB GPU and the best multi-T4 GPU on GC (4xT4) with Pytorch DDP (Figure 17) have almost double the throughput at 46 SPS and are slightly slower at 24 SPS, respectively, compared to our 8xT4 setup which runs at 28 SPS. This outcome is not surprising due to the generational leap in architecture for the A100 and the slower interconnect with our 8xT4 experiments compared to a single 4xT4 node (see Section 3 for a detailed throughput analysis). The proposed cost-throughput ratio is mixed: the A100 is at $12.19/1M samples, the DDP 4xT4 is at $8.41/1M, and our 8xT4 is at $14.53/1M. Our proposed setup is slightly more expensive than the A100, and it will not scale beyond eight T4 GPUs due a granularity at 1.17, leaving the A100 as the fastest and the DDP 4xT4 setup as the cheaper but slower alternative.

In this work, we estimate the real-world environmental impact of developing a series of language models, ranging from 20 million to 13 billion active parameters, trained on up to 5.6 trillion tokens each. When accounting for hardware manufacturing, model development, and our final training runs, we find that our series of models released 493 metric tons of carbon emissions, equivalent to powering about 98 homes in the United States for one year, and consumed 2.769 million liters of water, equivalent to about 24.5 years of water usage by a person in the United States, even though our data center is extremely water-efficient. We measure and report the environmental impact of our model development; to the best of our knowledge we are the first to do so for LLMs, and we find that model development, the impact of which is generally not disclosed by most model developers, amounted to ~50% of that of training.

Also, not a single one of the values Birhane et al. identified was explicitly linked to environmental sustainability, highlighting once again the lack of connection in the research community with sustainability writ large."}

For instance, shifting from the dominant Western moral philosophies to include perspectives from non-Western traditions such as relational ethics [131], Ubuntu ethics [145], and Confucian ethics [111] can offer valuable insights into community, social harmony, and the interconnectedness of beings, emphasizing the impact of AI on society and interpersonal relationships."}

{"type": "text", "content": "Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into many online services, yet they remain cost-prohibitive to deploy due to the requirement of expensive GPU instances. Prior work has addressed the high cost of LLM serving by improving the inference engine, but less attention has been given to selecting the most cost-efficient GPU type(s) for a specific LLM service. There is a large and growing landscape of GPU types and, within these options, higher cost does not always lead to increased performance. Instead, through a comprehensive investigation, we find that three key LLM service characteristics (request size, request rate, SLO) strongly influence GPU cost efficiency, and differing GPU types are most cost efficient for differing LLM service settings. As a result, the most cost-efficient allocation for a given service is typically a mix of heterogeneous GPU types. Based on this analysis, we introduce Mélange, a GPU allocation framework that navigates these diverse LLM service characteristics and heterogeneous GPU option space to automatically and efficiently derive the minimal-cost GPU allocation for a given LLM service. We formulate the GPU allocation task as a cost-aware bin packing problem where GPUs are bins and items are slices of the service workload. Our formulation’s constraints account for a service’s unique characteristics, allowing Mélange to be flexible to support diverse service settings and heterogeneity-aware to adapt the GPU allocation to a specific service.

{"type": "text", "content": "Third, energy consumption was measured using CodeCarbon, a tool recognized for providing reliable estimates of a machine’s total energy use (Bouza et al., 2023). However, it does not allow for precise measurement of energy consumption at the level of individual processes. Moreover, power intake was recorded at 15-second intervals, meaning the accuracy of energy estimates improves with longer-running processes. Another limitation of CodeCarbon is that RAM energy consumption is approximated at 0.375W per GB of memory used. While the Running Average Power Limit (RAPL) framework can directly measure RAM power consumption, it is not supported on all CPUs (https://github.com/mlco2/codecarbon/issues/717#issuecomment-2589805160). Additionally, in shared computing environments such as high-performance computing (HPC) clusters, measurements may be affected by other users’ activities. Especially when an LLM was deployed across multiple nodes, variations in network traffic at different times may have influenced energy measurements.

However, it does not allow for precise measurement of energy consumption at the level of individual processes. Moreover, power intake was recorded at 15-second intervals, meaning the accuracy of energy estimates improves with longer-running processes. Another limitation of CodeCarbon is that RAM energy consumption is approximated at 0.375W per GB of memory used. While the Running Average Power Limit (RAPL) framework can directly measure RAM power consumption, it is not supported on all CPUs (https://github.com/mlco2/codecarbon/issues/717#issuecomment-2589805160).

{"type": "text", "content": "We analyze four models, the computational requirements of which we describe below. All models have code freely available online, which we used out-of-the-box. For more details on the models themselves, please refer to the original papers. Transformer. The Transformer model (Vaswani et al., 2017) is an encoder-decoder architecture primarily recognized for efficient and accurate machine translation. The encoder and decoder each consist of 6 stacked layers of multi-head self-attention. Vaswani et al. (2017) report that the Transformer base model (65M parameters) was trained on 8 NVIDIA P100 GPUs for 12 hours, and the Transformer big model (213M parameters) was trained for 3.5 days (84 hours; 300k steps). This model is also the basis for recent work on neural architecture search (NAS) for machine translation and language modeling (So et al., 2019), and the NLP pipeline that we study in more detail in §4.2 (Strubell et al., 2018). So et al. (2019) report that their full architecture search ran for a total of 979M training steps, and that their base model requires 10 hours to train for 300k steps on one TPUv2 core. This equates to 32,623 hours of TPU or 274,120 hours on 8 P100 GPUs. ELMo. The ELMo model (Peters et al., 2018) is based on stacked LSTMs and provides rich word representations in context by pre-training on a large amount of data using a language modeling objective. Replacing context-independent pre-trained word embeddings with ELMo has been shown to increase performance on downstream tasks such as named entity recognition, semantic role labeling, and coreference. Peters et al. (2018) report that ELMo was trained on 3 NVIDIA GTX 1080 GPUs for 2 weeks (336 hours). BERT. The BERT model (Devlin et al., 2019) provides a Transformer-based architecture for building contextual representations similar to ELMo, but trained with a different language modeling objective. BERT substantially improves accuracy on tasks requiring sentence-level representations such as question answering and natural language inference. Devlin et al. (2019) report that the BERT base model (110M parameters) was trained on 16 TPU chips for 4 days (96 hours). NVIDIA reports that they can train a BERT model in 3.3 days (79.2 hours) using 4 DGX-2H servers, totaling 64 Tesla V100 GPUs (Forster et al., 2019). GPT-2. This model is the latest edition of OpenAI’s GPT general-purpose token encoder, also based on Transformer-style self-attention and trained with a language modeling objective (Radford et al., 2019). By training a very large model on massive data, Radford et al. (2019) show high zero-shot performance on question answering and language modeling benchmarks.
